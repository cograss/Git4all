#Git4all
##A complete GIT GUI for Linux using [*GAMBAS*](http://gambas.sourceforge.net/) lang.

   ### THIS PROJECT IS A GREAT WAY OF LEARNING VISUAL BASIC FOR LINUX

* Why Gambas?
  The idea is to bring more Microsoft Windows programmers into Linux 
operating systems. Gambas is a lang like Visual Basic, and the IDE
looks a lot like Microsoft's Visual Studio. Plenty of documentation
and examples can be found online.

* Why another GUI for git?
  Git4all will have only one dependency: git.
The plan is to make a gui that does all jobs that can be done with the
git command line.
